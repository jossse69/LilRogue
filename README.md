# Lil Rogue
Lil Rogue is a small hobby game made by me (jos√© luiz) as fun pesonal project, it uses C#, RogueSharp,  and SFML for the rest (rendering, input, etc).

## playing the game
just go to releases and download the `.zip` file, not hard.

## controls
use numpad to move, runing into a enemy attacks it.

## Want to contribute?
