# Lil Rogue
Lil Rogue is a small hobby game made by me (jos√© luiz) as fun pesonal project, it uses C#, RogueSharp,  and SFML for the rest (rendering, input, etc).

## playing the game
just go to [releases](https://github.com/jossse69/LilRogue/releases).

## controls
use numpad to move, runing into a enemy attacks it.
