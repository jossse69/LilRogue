# Lil Rogue
Lil Rogue is a small hobby game made by me (jos√© luiz) as fun pesonal project, it uses C#, RogueSharp,  and SFML for the rest (rendering, input, etc)

## playing the game
just clone it using `git clone https://github.com/jossse69/LilRogue.git`, i will later make bulids for it (hint, go to `bin\Debug\net7.0` and open `LilRogue.exe`)

## controls
use numpad to move
